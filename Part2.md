# Part 1

## **Introduction**
In this first part of the workshop, we will introduce the participants to React Native and Firebase, as well as present the main theme of the workshop which is the creation of a React Native application with Firebase integration, focusing on the creation of a Realtime Database and its use in the application.
React Native: React Native is an open source JavaScript framework developed by Facebook that allows you to create native mobile apps for iOS and Android using a syntax similar to React. One of the main advantages of React Native is the ability to develop cross-platform applications with a single code base, which saves time and reuses web development skills.
Firebase: Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform provided by Google. It offers a set of ready-to-use tools and services for mobile and web application development, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than server infrastructure management.
Benefits of Firebase: Firebase offers many useful features for application development, such as user authentication, file storage, web hosting, push notifications, analytics, etc. In this workshop, we will focus specifically on the use of Firebase Realtime Database, which provides a real-time database that is instantly synchronized across all connected clients.
Workshop Objective: The main objective of this workshop is to teach participants how to integrate Firebase into a React Native application and use the Realtime Database for creating, reading, updating and deleting real-time data. They will have the opportunity to gain a practical understanding of how React Native and Firebase can be combined to create powerful and interactive mobile applications.

## **EX 1**
In this part of the workshop, we will dive into creating a Realtime Database using Firebase. We will explore the basic concepts of this realtime database and configure the Firebase database in our React Native application.
Basic concepts of Realtime Database : Firebase Realtime Database is a real-time cloud database that stores and synchronizes data between connected clients. Key features of the Realtime Database include real-time synchronization, conflict management, and data structure flexibility.
Firebase Database Configuration:

-create an account on Firebase

-create a new project

-create a realtime database in this project

-recover the datbase info in setting/info



## **EX 2**
In this part of the workshop, we will explore how to retrieve data from the Firebase Realtime Database and display it in the user interface of our React Native application.
Database Reference Setup:

First, import the Firebase module and initialize it with your Firebase configuration.

```bash
Npm install firebase
```

1 - Create a database reference using firebase.database().ref().

2 - Utilisez la méthode once() pour récupérer les données depuis une référence spécifique.

3- Displaying data in the UI:
Once you have retrieved the data, use it to update the user interface of your React Native application.
For example, you can use the data to populate a list or grid of items in your application using React Native components such as .map()

4 - Handling errors and loading situations:
Be sure to handle potential errors during data recovery by using the catch block in the promise.
While loading data, you can display a loading indicator in your user interface to let the user know that data is being retrieved.
With these steps, you'll be able to retrieve data from Firebase's Realtime Database and display it in your React Native app's UI. Feel free to customize the code according to your application's needs and add additional features to improve the user experience.Handling errors.

## **EX 3**
In this part of the workshop, we will explore how to send data from our React Native application to the Firebase Realtime Database.
Database Reference Setup:
Make sure you have already imported and initialized the Firebase module and created a database reference, as explained in the previous part.

Creating an input form:
In your React Native application, create an input form to collect user information, such as name, email address, etc. Use React Native components such as TextInput to allow the user to enter the data.

Sending data to the Realtime Database:
In the handleSubmit function, use the push() method to add the data entered by the user to the database.

Validating data before sending:
Before sending the data to Firebase, be sure to validate the data to ensure it is correct and complete.

With these steps, you'll be able to collect user-entered data in your React Native app and send it to Firebase's Realtime Database. Be sure to tailor the code to the specific needs of your application and add additional functionality, such as error handling, data validation, and resetting input fields after the data is sent.


## **Conclusion**
Congratulations! You have now gained the knowledge to develop a React Native application with Firebase integration, implementing a Realtime Database for real-time data management. In this final part of the workshop, we'll recap what we learned and explore some suggestions for taking your learning and future projects further.
To go further:
In this workshop, we learned about the benefits of React Native as a cross-platform mobile app development framework and Firebase as a BaaS platform that offers a variety of services to facilitate app development.
We learned how to set up our development environment, create a Realtime Database with Firebase, retrieve data from the database, display it in our React Native app, and finally, send user input to the database.
Next steps:
Now that you have a solid foundation, here are a few suggestions to deepen your knowledge and go further:

User authentication: Explore user authentication with Firebase to secure your application. Implement user registration, login and management features.

File storage: Use the Firebase storage service to allow users to upload and store files (images, videos, documents) in your application.

Push notifications: Integrate Firebase's push notification service to send targeted notifications to your users, keeping them informed of updates and improving application engagement.

Analytics and performance tracking: Use Firebase's analytics tools to gain valuable insights into your application's usage, user performance and the effectiveness of your features.

UI Enhancements: Explore popular React Native components and libraries to improve the look and feel of your application. Use features such as routing, animations, and custom components.
